        <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>I'm Ariadne Spontone, I was born in the city of Botucatu which is in the countryside 
            of the state of São Paulo in Brazil on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 1985. I am the second daughter, and 
            I was born ten years after my brother, being considered an only child. Throughout my 
            childhood I had contact with many adult people whose main characteristic was doing, 
            with that I learned many techniques and developed good manual skills.
        </p>
        <p>Already in adolescence, I tested <em>many possibilities</em>, through sports, arts and even religions.
           Having little financial availability, I learned early on to <strong>save and plan</strong> what I would like to 
           accomplish. Today I see that this skill should be the basic subject of <abbr title="Early Childhood Education">ECE</abbr>. 
           This vast experience in various fields enabled me to learn to see the same scenario from 
           different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>Today, already in the <em>adult phase of life</em>, I consider myself a struggling person who conquers 
            his dreams and is not afraid to fight for what I believe, all with an attentive eye to the small 
            details and great nuances that different points of view can bring. I am currently married and 
            have two daughters; both bring me daily <strong>challenges and joys</strong> that drive me to always seek to be 
            a better person every day.
