            <h3>Minha história</h3>
            <p>I'm Ariadne Spontone, I was born in the city of Botucatu which is in the countryside 
                of the state of São Paulo in Brazil on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 1985. I am the second daughter, and 
                I was born ten years after my brother, being considered an only child. Throughout my 
                childhood I had contact with many adult people whose main characteristic was doing, 
                with that I learned many techniques and developed good manual skills.
            </p>
            <p>Already in adolescence, I tested <em>many possibilities</em>, through sports, arts and even religions.
                Having little financial availability, I learned early on to <strong>save and plan</strong> what I would like to 
                accomplish. Today I see that this skill should be the basic subject of <abbr title="Early Childhood Education">ECE</abbr>. 
                This vast experience in various fields enabled me to learn to see the same scenario from 
                different perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>Today, already in the <em>adult phase of life</em>, I consider myself a struggling person who conquers 
                his dreams and is not afraid to fight for what I believe, all with an attentive eye to the small 
                details and great nuances that different points of view can bring. I am currently married and 
                have two daughters; both bring me daily <strong>challenges and joys</strong> that drive me to always seek to be 
                a better person every day.
            </p>

                <h3>My hobbies</h3>
                <p>Currently my hobbies are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cycling;</li>
                    <li>Sewing notebooks.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I've been riding my bike since moving to Canada for all the everyday activities and it's been a lot of fun. 
                    My second hobby is hand-sewing handmade notebooks, in which I can use my creativity and create a unique notebook 
                    for each person I want to give. This activity brings me pleasure and a feeling of well-being.
